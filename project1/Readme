In this project, I simulate client-server socket programming using TCP.

On the server side, I do following things:
1. use getaddrinfo() to get address information
2. use socket() to get the socket file descriptor
3. use setsocketopt() to reuse the port
4. use bind() to associate socket with the port
5. use listen() to listen for any connetions
6. use accpet() to create a new socket file descriptor for the connection from client
7. use recv() to recieve message from client
8. use send() to send message to client

On the client side, I do following things:
1. use getaddrinfo() to get address information
2. use socket() to get the socket file descriptor
3. use connect() to connet to server
7. use send() to send message to server
8. use recv() to recieve message from server
